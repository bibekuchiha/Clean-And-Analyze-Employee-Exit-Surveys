## Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys
In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE here. 

In this project, we'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:

* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?  
What about employees who have been there longer?

* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

In this project, wecompleted the following tasks:
* Explored the data and figured out how to prepare it for analysis
* Corrected some of the missing values
* Dropped any data not needed for our analysis
* Renamed our columns
* Verified the quality of our data
* Created a new institute_service column
* Cleaned the Contributing Factors columns
* Created a new column indicating if an employee resigned because they were dissatisfied in some way
* Combined the data
* Cleaned the institute_service column
* Handled the missing values in the dissatisfied column
* Aggregated the data
